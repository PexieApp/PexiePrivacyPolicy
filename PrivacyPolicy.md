####Updated on January 1, 2017. Version history can be found at https://github.com/pexieapp/PexiePrivacyPolicy.


We are not in the business of collecting your data or selling you ads. 
Your privacy is very important to you and hence important to us. 
We wrote this policy to help you understand the privacy 
implications of using Pexie. Please read it carefully. If you have any

##When You Use the Pexie App


By default, any data you store in Pexie stay in your device, unless you 
explicitly choose to export and share them. We do not have any visibility of, 
or access to the data you store in Pexie, and we intend to keep it that way. 


##When You Contact Pexie Support via Email


We may ask you for information that may help us diagnose technical issues, 
such as software version numbers, hardware setup, free storage space available 
on your devices, etc. You are not required to share any of the information if 
you so choose.


We use FastMail as our email service provider and FogBugz to manage customer 
support. Therefore, the email communications are also visible to these service 
providers. Below are their privacy policies:
